# Popular Programming Languages

In this study we will explore which programming language is most popular according to Google Trends. 

- Request data from Google Trends
- Extract data by using key words in a list (Search is limited to 5 words at a time)
- Command the pytrends object to search for the keywords and return data
- Specify the keywords list and timeframe to be searched
- Visualize the data by creating a line plot.
- Analyze the data by isolating each language against Python to compare trends.

Lets take this a step further by analyzing what are the top countries that are searching for Python.
- First, extract country-level keywords search data
- Next, get ranking countries with the highest searches of "Python"
- Create a plot to viusalize the countries with the highest number of Python searches on Google

Now we will tie together the Google Trends of the programming languages and top countries to visualize which countries have the highest searches and what language they are searching for.
